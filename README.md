# Apyllon
Apyllon is a shared music player, hosted on a local machine. Each logged in client user is able to: 
* upload local files to the server or to provide links, pointing to a song on Youtube.
* create playlists
* control the player

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate into it
```
git clone https://github.com/Biskit1943/Apyllon.git && cd Apyllon
```
Start with Docker
``` docker-compose up ```
* Open Browser and navigate to localhost:80 to test the frontend
* Open Browser on localhost:8080/apidocs to test the backend

For the initial login to the frontend, use the username: "admin" and the generated password, 
printed in the docker-compose console. As soon as you logged in for the first time, 
it is **highly recommended** to change the admin password.
